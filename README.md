# The Habitat System
Coding the SIDB Habitat System project.

## What is the habitat system?
The Habitat System is intended to provide data gathering & control functionality to a 40 mouse habitat, to support experiments conducted by SIDB.

### Data Gathering
The data gathered includes video from an array of cameras, RFID detection events, recordings of ultrasonic mice vocalizations from specialised microphones, and general I/O peripherals.

### System Architecure
The proposed system architecture features a main controller connected to "plug and play" sensor/actuator modules via power-over-ethernet. 

## This Codebase
This codebase provides code for the main controller and modules.
