Coding project proposal – modular synchronised data capture system.

In most of our behavioural testing labs, we are trying to record the experiment one or more of light, sound, events often while controlling the timing of other equipment such as feeders or optogenetic stimulators. Many of our systems have been designed from scratch resulting in many variations on a theme that require unnecessary effort to support. In some cases, we have not been able to meet specification due to the cost of a single powerful capture system or have ended up using expensive tools designed for a different purpose.
Concept
Provide a basic set of module types based on inexpensive hardware that can be quickly connected through a single data cable with POE to a controller that will synchronise all the units, monitor their health, start and stop recordings/streams, collate the data and package them in raw or Neurodata without borders (https://www.nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/) format for further analysis and archiving. 
Modules
Each capture unit should be able to capture and compress data for given lengths of time then upload to the share identified by the controller. The unit should have a live stream mode for testing and monitoring. 

Controller: 	A unit providing very accurate time synchronisation using precise time protocol (ptp master) to all capture modules, control signalling, data collation and packaging. Record metadata for nwb.
